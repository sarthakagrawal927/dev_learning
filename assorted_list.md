### Various Cool Algorithms

1) Bloom FIlter

𝟮) 𝗙𝗥𝗨𝗚𝗔𝗟 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗚
It uses only one unit of memory per group to compute a quantile for each group.
Use Case: Find the nth percentile of the data stream.

𝟯) 𝗚𝗘𝗢𝗛𝗔𝗦𝗛/ 𝗦𝟮 𝗚𝗘𝗢𝗠𝗘𝗧𝗥𝗬
A collection of efficient yet exact mathematical predicates for testing relationships among geometric primitives.
Use Case:Location-based search results with DynamoDb and Geohash.

𝟰) 𝗛𝗬𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗟𝗢𝗚𝗟𝗢𝗚
It is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset.
Use Case: privacy-preserving traffic heat map for the city.

𝟱) 𝗟𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗬 𝗕𝗨𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧/ 𝗧𝗢𝗞𝗘𝗡 𝗕𝗨𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧
A mechanism to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the network.
Use Case: Design a scalable rate-limiting algorithm.

𝟲) 𝗟𝗢𝗦𝗦𝗬 𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗧
It is used to identify elements in a data stream whose frequency count exceeds a user-given threshold.
Use Case: Frequency count over the data streams.

𝟳) 𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗔𝗟 𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗦𝗙𝗢𝗥𝗠𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡
It is used for supporting a range of collaboration functionalities in advanced collaborative software systems.
Use Case: Handling editing collision in Google docs.

𝟴) 𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗗𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗘/ 𝗥𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗘
It is a two-dimensional analog of octrees and is most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.
Use Case: find nearby interest points

𝟵) 𝗥𝗔𝗬 𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚
It is the most basic of many computer graphics rendering algo that uses geometric algo of ray tracing.
Use Case: using longitude and latitude, return the Country of the point.

𝟭𝟬) 𝗥𝗘𝗩𝗘𝗥𝗦𝗘 𝗜𝗡𝗗𝗘𝗫
It is an index of keywords that stores records of documents that contain keywords in the list.
Use Case: Create a complete Tweet index.

𝟭𝟭) 𝗥𝗦𝗬𝗡𝗖 𝗔𝗟𝗚𝗢𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗛𝗠
Used for reducing the cost of a file transfer by avoiding the transfer of blocks that are already at the destination.
Use Case:: Streaming file Sync
